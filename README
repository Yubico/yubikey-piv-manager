== YubiKey PIV Tool
Tool for configuring your PIV-enabled YubiKey.

=== Installation
The recommended way to install this software including dependencies is by using
the provided precompiled binaries for your platform. For Windows and OS X,
there are installers available for download
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-pivtool-gui/Releases/[here].
For Ubuntu we have a custom PPA with a package for it
https://launchpad.net/~yubico/+archive/ubuntu/stable[here].

=== Dependencies
YubiKey PIV Tool requires PySide, pycrypto and yubico-piv-tool.

=== Running tests
Tests can be run using the "nosetests" command, from the python-nose package.
Anternatively "python setup.py test" can be used, but this will cause PySide
to be compiled from source, requiring the python-dev package.

=== Building binaries
Binaries for Windows and OSX are built using PyInstaller.

Get the source release file, yubikey-pivtool-gui-<version>.tar.gz, and extract
it. It should contain a single directory, henceforth refered to as the release
directory.

When building binaries for Windows or OS X, you will need to include
.dll/.dylib files from the yubico-piv-tool project, as well as the
yubico-piv-tool executable. Create a subdirectory called "lib" in the release
directory.
Download the correct binary release for your architecture from
http://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/Releases/ and extract the 
.dll/.dylib files and executable to the "lib" directory you created previously.

==== Windows
For Windows you will need python, PySide, PyCrypto, PyInstaller and Pywin32
installed (32 or 64-bit versions depending on the architecture of the binary
your are building).

To sign the executable, copy the pfx file to pivtool.pfx and place it in the
root of the release directory. You will need signtool.exe (from the Windows
SDK) either copied into the root as well or in a location in your PATH.

Run "pyinstaller.exe resources/pivtool.spec" from the main release directory.

With NSIS installed, a Windows installer will be built as well.

==== OSX
For OSX you need python, pyside, pycrypto, and pyinstaller installed. One way 
to install these dependencies is by using Homebrew:

  brew install python
  brew install pyside
  pip install PyInstaller
  pip install pycrypto

NOTE: Homebrew will build backwards-incompatible binaries, so the resulting
build will not run on an older version of OSX.

Run "pyinstaller resources/pivtool.spec" from the main release directory. This
will create an .app in the dist directory.

Sign the code using codesign:

  codesign -s 'Developer ID Application' dist/YubiKey\ PIV\ Tool.app --deep

There is also a project file for use with 
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Packaging.html[Packages]
located at `resources/pivtool.pkgproj`.
This can be used to create an installer for distribution, which you should sign
prior to distribution:

  packagesbuild resources/pivtool.pkgproj
  productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer' dist/YubiKey\ PIV\ Tool.pkg dist/yubico-pivtool-gui-mac.pkg
